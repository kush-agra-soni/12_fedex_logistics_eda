These were converted into numeric types using `pd.to_numeric()`. This step ensures proper handling of these columns for mathematical and statistical operations like calculating mean and filling missing values.\n","     - `errors='coerce'` was used to convert any non-numeric values to `NaN`, ensuring that errors due to invalid data would not stop the process.\n","\n","### 3. **Handling Missing Data:**\n","   - **Filling Missing Data for Categorical Columns:**\n","     - **`Shipment Mode`** (a categorical column) had missing values. The most frequent value (mode) of this column was used to fill the missing entries. This is a common technique for categorical data, as the mode represents the most common or \"default\" category.\n","     \n","     - **`Dosage`** (another categorical column) had missing values. We used the mode of this column (if missing values exist) to fill the gaps. If the column had no missing values, this step is skipped.\n","   \n","   - **Filling Missing Data for Numeric Columns:**\n","     - **`Line Item Insurance (USD)`** had missing values, so the median was used to fill the gaps. The median is often preferred for numeric columns when the data might be skewed because it is less affected by outliers.\n","     - **`Weight (Kilograms)` and `Freight Cost (USD)`** had missing values and were filled with their respective means. For numeric data that is relatively normally distributed, using the mean is a reasonable approach. However, the data might be checked later for skewness or outliers if further accuracy is needed.\n","\n","### 4. **Rounding Values:**\n","   - After filling missing values, **`Weight (Kilograms)`** and **`Freight Cost (USD)`** were rounded to **2 decimal places**. Rounding ensures that the data is clean and follows a standardized format, improving readability and precision, especially when these values will be used for analysis or reporting.\n","\n","### 5. **Missing Data Check:**\n","   - At the end of the process, a check was done for any remaining missing values across all columns. This ensures that all missing data has been properly handled. If any column still contains missing values, further treatment may be needed.\n","\n","### Insights:\n","\n","- **Data Quality Improvement:**\n","  - The removal of unnecessary columns reduces noise in the dataset, focusing on more relevant features for analysis.\n","  - Converting the weight and cost columns into numeric types ensures they can be used in mathematical calculations without errors.\n","  \n","- **Handling of Missing Values:**\n","  - For categorical data like `Shipment Mode` and `Dosage`, filling with the mode ensures that the most common value is used, maintaining the consistency of the dataset.\n","  - For numerical data, using the mean (for normal distribution) or median (for skewed data) helps ensure that the missing values don’t bias the analysis.\n","\n","- **Data Precision:**\n","  - Rounding `Weight (Kilograms)` and `Freight Cost (USD)` ensures a more standardized and easily interpretable dataset, especially when dealing with financial and physical quantities where extra precision is not necessary.\n","\n","- **Next Steps:**\n","  - Now that missing values are handled and the data is cleaned, it’s easier to perform deeper statistical analysis, model training, or reporting.\n","  - Further exploration could include checking for outliers or data trends, particularly in `Weight (Kilograms)` and `Freight Cost (USD)`, as these are critical columns for the analysis of shipping and logistics.\n","  \n","This approach leads to a cleaner, more reliable dataset, which is crucial for accurate analysis, model training, or reporting."],"metadata":{"id":"LbyXE7I1olp8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## ***4.
